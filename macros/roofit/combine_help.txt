This is a hopefully growing instruction on how to run our limits.

First compile with only make (no make -j).
And export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/nfs/dust/cms/user/abenecke/CMSSW_10_2_10/CMSSW_10_2_10/src/UHH2/SingleTth/macros/roofit

Than run ./create_roo

It will create a rootfile debug_histos.root with the histograms generated from the functions used in combine. This histogram is also printed to test_hist[ech/much].eps
In addition, the fit function and the underlying histogram will be plottet in test_[ech/much].pdf.

and it will create the workspace in datacards: ws_SingleTth.root

In datacards you can run combine on the following datacards:
DataCard2016_M600.txt -> limits with the functions
DataCard2016_M600_debug_histograms.txt -> limits on the histograms generated from the functions
DataCard2016_M600_histograms.txt -> limits on the histogram we feed in theta

if you want to run on histograms use the following command:
combine datacard.txt -M AsymptoticLimits --noFitAsimov --run blind -n outputname

if you want to run on functions use the follwing command:
combine -M AsymptoticLimits -d datacard.txt -t -1 -n outputname --freezeParameters sg_mean,sg_sigma

!The freezeParameters is needed to NOT give combine the freedom to change the signal!

if you want to see the shapes used by combine, pre and post fit, use the following command:
combine -M FitDiagnostics -d datacard.txt -t -1 -n outputname --saveWorkspace --saveShapes
